       <p>I thought I heard the Old Man say
        "Leave her, Johnny, leave her"
        Tomorrow ye will get your pay
        And it's time for us to leave her
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
        For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
        And it's time for us to leave her
        Oh, the wind was foul and the sea ran high
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        She shipped it green and none went by
        And it's time for us to leave her
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
        For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
        And it's time for us to leave her
        I hate to sail on this rotten tub
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        No grog allowed and rotten grub
        And it's time for us to leave her
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
        For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
        And it's time for us to leave her
        We swear by rote for want of more
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        But now we're through so we'll go on shore
        And it's time for us to leave her
        Leave her, Johnny, leave her
        Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
        For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
        And it's time for us to leave her</p>
